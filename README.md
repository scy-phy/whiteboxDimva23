# White-box Concealment Attacks Against Anomaly Detectors for Cyber-Physical Systems
## in proceedings at DIMVA 2023

- Each folder contains the whitebox attack code, the attacked model and the resulting adversarial examples
    - all the adversarial examples can be created starting from SWaT dataset available upon request from iTrust Singapore http://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/

- Spoofing Framework folder contains the SWaT data and the black-box adversarial examples generated with the framework by Erba et al. https://github.com/scy-phy/ICS_Generic_Concealment_Attacks

 
- compute_cost_sample.py is the script used to compute the Euclidean and hamming distance

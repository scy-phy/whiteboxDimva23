The code is based on the publication https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8418629

We thank the authors for sharing the code of the SVM detector.

The the detection code in this folder is based on the code shared with us but modified to work with the SWAT dataset (and not the swat simulator). 
Especially we moved from a binary classification SVM to a One class SVM and perform grid search for parameter tuning.  
Data processing is the same as described in the original paper.
